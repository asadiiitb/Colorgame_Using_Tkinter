# Colorgame_Using_Tkinter
In this project we made a simple GUI based color game using tkinter. In this game we will be displayed a color name and that color name will be filled with a color, so the user just need to type the color filled inside. We will be having a timer of 30 seconds and user can answer anynumber of times withing time limit. 

# Requirements
To play this game all you need is Python3.6 or above version installed in your system along with the tkinter (To install tkinter you can install it using command pip3 install python3-tkinter or ypu can look into its documentation).

# Hot to start game
Once all environment setup is done you just need to run the file using command python3 Color_game_by_tkinter.py
